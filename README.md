A weather app built with Flutter and API integration is a mobile application designed to provide users with real-time weather information for their location or any other specified location. The app uses Flutter, a popular open-source framework for building high-performance, cross-platform mobile applications, to create a beautiful and intuitive user interface. The API integration allows the app to retrieve weather data from various sources and display it in an easy-to-understand format.

Users can also search for weather information for any other location by clicking the rightside top icon and after opening you can enter the city and it will display the current weather.
